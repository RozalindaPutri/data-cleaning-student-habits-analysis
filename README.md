# Student Habits Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis

📌 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with an emphasis on **data cleaning and preprocessing**.
The objective is to ensure data quality by handling missing values, checking duplicates, and validating data consistency before further analysis or visualization.
The dataset contains student habits and academic performance data and demonstrates fundamental data preprocessing skills using Python.

🎯 **Objectives**
* Identify and handle missing values
* Check data consistency and validity
* Detect duplicate records
* Prepare a clean dataset for further analysis
* Improve data quality for accurate insights
  
📊 **Dataset Information**
* Source: Kaggle – *Student Habits vs Academic Performance*
* File: `student_habits_performance.csv`
* Records: 1,000 rows
* Variables: 16 columns

🔍 **Key Data Cleaning Steps**
* Detected missing values in the `parental_education_level` column
* Handled missing values using:
  * **Mode** for categorical data
  * **Mean** for numerical data
* Checked for duplicate records (none found)
* Verified dataset after cleaning

🧠 **Key Findings**
* Only one column contained missing values and was successfully handled.
* Data distributions showed reasonable ranges and consistency.
* The dataset is clean and ready for visualization or advanced analysis.

🛠 **Tools Used**
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📂 **Project Deliverables**
* Python notebook / script
* Cleaned dataset
* PDF presentation

📝 **Notes**

* This project focuses solely on **data cleaning and preprocessing**.
* No machine learning models were applied.
* The dataset is intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
